##Yeoman: An Introduction

In this episode of the Frienster Brown Bag, I will take a look at how the Yeoman Workflow can help you improve your Front End development workflow with tools from [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) itself, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io).

### More

The goal here is to setup a very basic development environment and using [generator-simple](https://github.com/robdodson/generator-simple) is the perfect Yeoman generator. Yeoman's default [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) is far from a basic setup.

### Credits

Many thanks to the wonderful [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) itself, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io) and [generator-simple](http://github.com/robdodson/generator-simple). Rock on!
